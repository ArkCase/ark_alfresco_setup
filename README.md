# ark_alfresco_setup

The purpose of the container app is to run the python code to create the required Alfresco sites, folders, categories, and memberships in order for ArkCase to work with Alfresco. 
This script uses the Alfresco REST API for all communication and API interaction.
The script relies on a properties file to identify the groups, sites, folder names, and categories to be created.
